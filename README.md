In this task, a dynamic web form has been developed.The username field accepts email formats, and its validation has been seamlessly integrated into the form to ensure adherence to the specified email format. The password field is enhanced with masking functionality, providing an added layer of confidentiality by concealing entered characters. Furthermore, strict validation rules have been implemented, restricting the password to only include '@', uppercase letters, and numbers.
